# Py7TDMI

Yay! ARM7TDMI for Python enthusiasts.
Ever wanted to play with ARM7TDMI without a physical board? Now you can!

## Features

* Pythonic ARM7TDMI core implementation
* Supports ARM and Thumb instruction sets
* Step-by-step execution for learning or debugging
* Educational and fun

## Quickstart

```python
import numpy as np
from py7tdmi import ARM7TDMI

# Create a memory array (1MB)
memory = np.zeros(1024*1024, dtype=np.uint8)

# Initialize CPU
cpu = ARM7TDMI(memory, trace=True)

# Step 10 instructions
cpu.step_batch(10)
```
